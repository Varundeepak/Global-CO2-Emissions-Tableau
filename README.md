# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis (2000–2023)

This project explores real-world trends in carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, energy usage, and economic output across countries using the [Our World in Data CO₂ Dataset](https://github.com/owid/co2-data).

The goal is to derive meaningful insights using Python and visualize them interactively using Tableau Public.
